This repository is a **single, unified workspace** for my long-term QAOA research.  
It brings together **multiple quantum SDKs**, consistent toy cases (e.g., Max-Cut, JSSP), reproducible workflows, and backend comparisons into one coherent structure.  
The goal is to provide a **clean, scalable platform** for experimentation, benchmarking, and teaching QAOA across different frameworks.

---

## Features

- Unified **multi-SDK** structure (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, PennyLane, Qulacs, QSim)
- Clear **toy_cases** for Max-Cut and JSSP
- Reproducible workflows for **CPU/GPU** simulation (will be updated)
- Shared utilities for logging, reproducibility, and experiment design
- Consistent project structure across frameworks
- Ready-to-use **notebooks** for end-to-end examples

---

## Results

- Verified QAOA pipelines implemented in multiple frameworks  
- Clean, comparable structure for running the same problem across SDKs  
- Working JSSP and Max-Cut toy cases  
- Qiskit 2.x primitives supported (will be updated)
- CUDA-Q and PennyLane backends functional  
- Explorer setup for benchmarking and scaling behaviour

---

## Next steps

- Backend comparison benchmarks (performance, depth, stability)  
- GPU acceleration workflows for tensor network simulators (will be updated)  
- Warm-start variants and advanced mixer designs  
- More real-world optimization instances  
- Expanded documentation and diagrams  
- Automatic visualization of energy landscapes and schedules
